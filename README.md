# JavaScript Calculator

## Overview

This calculator replicates the behavior of a standard calculator, including chained operations, decimal support, order of operations, and more. It uses **formula logic** rather than immediate execution logic, and is compatible with the freeCodeCamp test suite.

## Features

- Supports all basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Input validation for decimals, multiple operators, and leading zeros
- Chained calculations with proper order of operations
- Negative number support
- Clear and equals functionality
- Dynamic display of current input and results
- Built-in precision for floating-point operations

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS Modules or custom styling
- FreeCodeCamp test bundle

## Project Requirements

- Clickable buttons for numbers (0â€“9), operators, decimal, clear, and equals
- Unique IDs for each button and display
- Input/output shown in a single display
- Prevents multiple leading zeros or multiple decimals
- Handles chained calculations and consecutive operators
- Allows continued operations after evaluating an expression
- Precision handling for decimal numbers (e.g., 2 / 7 = 0.2857...)
